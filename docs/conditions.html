<p><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>1.1 Your purchase of Tokens (as defined below) during the Token Sale (as defined below) from Envilope Limited, a company registered in Gibraltar, at registered address: Suite 6.20 World Trade Center, 6 Bayside Road, Gibraltar, GX11 1AA (<strong>Company</strong>, <strong>we</strong>, <strong>our</strong> or <strong>us</strong>) is subject to these terms of sale (Terms). Each of you and Company is a party and together are the parties.</p>
<p>1.2 By purchasing Tokens during the Token Sale and indicating your acceptance of these Terms on the Website, you will be bound by these Terms and any other terms incorporated by reference. If you have any questions regarding these Terms, please contact us at admin@envilope.com.</p>
<p>1.3 In order to be eligible to participate in the Token Sale and to log into the Token Sale portal to make a purchase, you will have to go to the Website and provide us with your user credentials Your Wallet details. Your Wallet must support the Ethereum ERC-20 token standard in order to receive any Tokens you purchase from us.</p>
<p>1.4 The Token Issuing Entity is conducting a sale of Tokens and the Token Sale will be made available to a number of participants under these Terms.</p>
<p>1.5 The purpose of the Envilope Network project is to further enhance the process whereby Envilope creates virtual envelopes in which you can lock emails, digital files, or secure messages containing text, images, audio, video &#8211; anything that can be sent online. Envilope gives senders unprecedented privacy and control over their content, including who views it, when, and where. Only the intended recipient can open an Envilope, and only after accepting the sender’s terms and conditions. If you ever suspect a breach, you can entirely vaporize your content at will, regardless of how many times it has been shared or forwarded. You also have the ability to fully restore that vaporized content should you see fit. The sender of an Envilope is in total control of their information from end-to-end and all interactions with an Envilope can be immutably recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain. The goal is to transform the way people can transmit their data and yet remain in complete control of it using a new distributed ledger-based platform Network for which the Company provides a number of incentivisation mechanisms. Further information is available in the White Paper.</p>
<p>1.6 Once developed and built, the Network is intended to focus on the blockchain development necessary to launch a beta version of the blockchain integrations on the Envilope platform, a decentralized version of Envilope and also the move to powering the entire Envilope ecosystem with our token, LOCK.</p>
<p>1.7 The Network project is being made possible by contributions from the community in the form of the purchase of Tokens that will enable Network development and support of the associated ecosystem. The Token Sale is therefore intended to give Contributors the ability to support and transact on the Network.</p>
<p>1.8 Tokens will be an integral part of the Network as a means to support and intermediate services between users.</p>
<p>1.9 The Tokens are intended to fulfil the following functions:</p>
<p>(a) Network access<br />
(b) API licences<br />
(c) Rewards</p>
<p>1.10 The Network is likely to be of use to the following sectors : Legal, Financial, Insurance, Corporate, Telecom, Healthcare, Marketing, Entertainment, Government &#8211; in fact anyone who wants to send their content and keep control of it, however, certain information on the Network may also be useful to other third parties</p>
<p>1.11 The Contributions from the Token Sale will be distributed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Contributors: 1 Billion.<br />
(b) X Reserve: 1 Billion Tokens. This portion will be allocated to reward early adopters and provide liquidity to the market if required.<br />
(c) X Team: 1 Billion Tokens. This will be allocated as rewards for our advisors and team</p>
<p>1.12 Token value will likely reflect the scale and growth potential of the Network and its usability.</p>
<p>1.13 We do not control the underlying technological infrastructure for the Tokens or the Network protocols (<strong>Blockchain</strong>) or third-party applications related thereto. We are not responsible or liable for the Blockchain, the operation of the Network or any third-party uses of the Network.</p>

<p>4.1 In consideration of payment of the Contributions, the Company will, or will ensure that the Token Issuing Entity will allocate and pay the number of Tokens Contributed for into Your Wallet from Our Wallet after the closing of the Token Sale.</p>
<p>4.2<strong> Commencement and Duration</strong>. The Company will conduct a public sale of Tokens (i.e. the <strong>Token Sale</strong>), which will begin at 00:01 UTC on May 7th 2018 (the<strong> Launch Date</strong>) and end at 00:00 UTC on October 8th 2018 or when 1 Billion of the Tokens have been sold, whichever is earlier (<strong>Availability Period</strong>).</p>
<p>4.3 Tokens shall be available during the Availability Period, after which no more tokens will be created. The total available amount of Tokens shall be fixed at 1 Billion and allocated as per paragraph 1 above.</p>
<p>4.4 In the event that less than the maximum allocation of 1 Billion for Contributors is reached, then the number of Tokens that are available but not allocated to Contributors will be listed on the Envilope platform for $0.50 each.</p>
<p><em>Contribution Failure</em></p>
<p>4.5 In the event that Contributions of less than $500,000 are received this shall result in withdrawal of the Token Sale (<strong>Contribution Failure</strong>) and the Token Sale shall be abandoned, no Tokens shall be issued and all Contributions shall be returned to you in full and final settlement of any obligations related to the Token Sale and your intention to acquire Tokens. These Terms shall terminate immediately upon return of your Contribution to Your Wallet.</p>
<p><em>Price Must Be Received in Full Within 24 Hours</em></p>
<p>4.6 If we have not received the payment of the full Price to Our Wallet within 24 hours of the time that you receive the payment instructions, we reserve the right to void your purchase request and refuse to accept your purchase of Tokens. For the avoidance of doubt, the Price will be deemed to be paid in full once we have received three (3) network confirmations of the transaction. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify any of the timelines described herein to account for network congestion or other technical challenges.</p>
<p>4.7 You must pay the Price by sending the correct quantity of ETH to the unique address displayed to you via the sale portal. Your purchase is not guaranteed until we receive the entire amount of the Price.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery of Tokens</strong></p>
<p>4.8 We will deliver the quantity of Tokens you purchase by the later of:</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) weeks after the Availability Period (although we may extend the delivery deadline for up to two (2) additional weeks if necessary to address any unforeseen technical difficulties), or;</li>
<li>one (1) week after you have provided a complete and accurate details of Your Wallet. For the avoidance of doubt, any such extension shall not affect our obligation to deliver, and your obligation to accept, the Tokens that have been acquired in accordance with these Terms.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Possible Migration of Tokens.</em></p>
<p>4.9 Tokens are being created as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum protocol. We reserve the right to migrate the ERC-20 based Tokens (<strong>Pre-existing Tokens</strong>) to another protocol and to generate replacement Tokens on the new protocol (<strong>Replacement Tokens</strong>) in the future, should we determine, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary or useful to the operation of the Network.</p>
<p>4.10 Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we may no longer provide support for the Pre-existing Tokens relating to the Network except with respect to the migration process. Although we do not at this time anticipate that it will require any Pre-existing Tokenholders to convert their Pre-existing Tokens to Replacement Tokens, we anticipate there will be significant incentives for Pre-existing Tokenholders to do so, since the practical utility of Pre-existing Tokens will likely diminish rapidly once the Replacement Tokens are created and in use by a significant portion of Network participants. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that in order for you to continue to participate in the Network or obtain utility from the Tokens you may need to convert the Tokens you purchase during the Sale to Replacement Tokens in the future.</p>
<p>4.11 Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we will notify you via the email address you provided to us at the time of the Sale. You are solely responsible for updating us should your contact information change.</p>
<p>4.12 You understand and acknowledge that, as the Tokens may be smart-contract based, their functionality is dependant on the ETH blockchain Smart Contract System (<strong>SCS</strong>): no other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or covenants for the Token Issuing Entity beyond those outlined in these Terms. In the event of any conflict between the SCS and these Terms, these Terms shall take precedence and any necessary changes to the SCS or Token shall be made accordingly. In certain circumstances, this may require Tokens to be entirely re-issued in substitution for the defective SCS or Tokens.</p>
<p>4.13 You agree that you shall have no further claims against the Company in respect of their support of the Network or the Token Sale in respect of any support, contribution or advice provided to the Company or Released Parties save for as detailed in these Terms and that receipt of your Tokens will constitute full performance of any promises, representations, contracts or statements made by the Company or any Released Parties in respect of the same.</p>

</div><div class="uncode_text_column" ><p><em>Contribution Limits:</em></p>
<p>5.3 The maximum number of Contributions that we will accept during the Token Sale will equate to the amount of ETH required to purchase the 1 Billion LOK tokens offered in the Token Sale (<strong>Contribution Cap</strong>).</p>
<p>5.4 We will not accept any Contributions after the Contribution Cap has been reached. In case, for example, due to technical reasons, the Contribution Software (defined below) accepts Contributions exceeding the Contribution Cap, the Contributions that exceed the Contribution Cap (calculated based on the time of receipt) shall be returned to the address the respective contribution transfer has been sent from.</p>
<p>5.5 There are no minimum or maximum Contribution amounts per Contributor.</p>
<p><em>Contribution Software:</em></p>
<p>5.6 Contributions in ETH must be made by using the SCS or to such other address we specify to you in writing herein or on our Sites (<strong>Contribution Software</strong>). Any Contribution in ETH to us without using the Contribution Software will not lead to a recommendation for Token allocation as set forth below.</p>
<p>5.7 Tokens will only be issued on behalf of the Token Issuing Entity during the Availability Period as specified in writing by us in these terms or on the Site. To the extent that any third-party website, service or smart-contract offers Tokens during the Availability Period or facilitates the allocation or transfer of Tokens in any way during the Availability Period or at any time up to Network launch, such third-party websites or services are, unless explicitly mentioned on the website specified above, not authorised by us and have no relationship in any way with us. We shall not be liable for you making any transfers of value to a wallet that is not Our Wallet as specified by us in writing.</p>
<p><em>Contribution timing and thresholds</em></p>
<p>5.8 Block Time Delay: You are aware that, due to Ethereum block time delay, the exact time of the end of the Availability Period cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>5.9 Contribution Freeze/Abort: During the Availability Period, we may at any time stop the contribution function for technical, legal or security reasons. As long as such contribution freeze is upheld or if the Availability Period is aborted, no further Contribution will be possible.</p>
<p><strong>5.10 You must ensure that you do not Contribute directly from an address provided by a cryptocurrency exchange service provider.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.11 You are responsible for ensuring that the address used for your Contribution is fit to handle return functions and particularly, must ensure that you do not Contribute directly from an address provided by a cryptocurrency exchange service provider: failure to do so, may lead to your loss of this ETH (pursuant to your intended Contribution) &#8211; this also applies in event that your Contribution is not accepted by the Contribution Software for any other reason.</strong></p>
<p><em>Contribution Information:</em></p>
<p>5.12 Relevant information relating to the Contributions made during the Availability Period shall be recorded by the Contribution Software (Contribution Information).</p>
<p>5.13 Upon a successful Contribution having been made, the Contribution Information will reflect the quantity of Tokens to be allocated to the Contributor in proportion to their Contribution.</p>
<p><em>Issuance of Tokens</em></p>
<p>5.14 The creation and allocation of Tokens are initiated by the Contributor sending ETH to the SCS, which triggers a smart contract operation. The SCS creates and allocates the corresponding Tokens to Your Wallet (i.e. from where the ETH was sent from).</p>
<p>5.15 Contributions will be accepted via ETH and BTC. Users will contribute only from a wallet or wallet service provider that technically supports ERC-20 Tokens.</p>
<p>5.16 Contributors shall ensure that they make a Contribution using an ETH address with which the Contribution Software can operate.</p>
<p><em>Token Functionality</em></p>
<p>5.17 Tokens are only intended for use in connection with the Network under the various applicable terms that shall be implemented when the Network is ready for use.</p>
<p>5.18 The exact functioning of Tokens on the Network shall only be determined once the Network is developed and fully operational and subject to any applicable terms of use of the Network.</p>
<p>5.19 Ownership of Tokens carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use Tokens as a mean to enable usage of and interaction with and within the Network, if the network is successfully completed and deployed. Beyond this, ownership of Tokens carries no other rights express or implied. In particular, you understand and accept that you have no right to claim as a holder of Tokens any intellectual property rights, income, profit, dividend, capital, equity, royalties or equivalent rights or any other form of economic or voting participation in or relating to the Token Issuing Entity, the Network and any parties related to the Network project.</p>
<p><strong>6. LEGAL STATUS OF TOKEN ISSUING ENTITY AND NETWORK PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>6.1 Tokens are a proprietary Blockchain token giving token holders the right to support operations on the Network.</p>
<p>6.2 The founders of the Token Issuing Entity have established the same in order to develop the Network and issue the Tokens to Contributors.</p>
<p>6.3 Acquisitions of Tokens are non-refundable. Tokens are not redeemable to the Token Issuing Entity other than as specifically advised in the terms herein and any terms applicable to use of the Network.</p>
<p>6.4 Tokens can only be acquired and used in connection with the Network with other participants under these Terms, the SCS and subject to any other terms and conditions that will be implemented for users of the Network on which the Tokens shall be usable. Tokens have no nominal or par value.</p>
<p>6.5 By contributing to the Network project including by receiving, using and holding Tokens, no form of partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between the Contributors, the Token Issuing Entity and/or other individuals or entities involved with the Network and the project shall be created or envisaged.</p>
<p><strong>7. NETWORK LAUNCH</strong></p>
<p>If we are successful in developing the Network, when we determine that the technology, protocols and ecosystem have been sufficiently developed to allow the Network to be launched, we will issue a public announcement, including any relevant material information, to Tokenholders.</p>

<p>(s) have reviewed the non-exhaustive indicative list of Risk Factors associated with the proposed Token Sale, the Tokens and the Network project.</p>
<p><strong>9. PROVISION OF INFORMATION &amp; PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>9.1 We may determine, in our sole discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations in connection with selling Tokens to you. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request and acknowledge that we may refuse to sell Tokens to you until you provide such requested information and we have determined that it is permissible to sell you Tokens under applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p>9.2 Identity and Disclosure. You shall provide true and complete information to us. You shall also provide us with such other information as we may reasonably request from time to time.</p>
<p>9.3 You shall not use fictitious or alias names for the registration, which shall be considered a breach of these Terms.</p>
<p>9.4 You consent to the Company, and any member of the Group, capturing and processing data relating to you for:</p>
<p>(a) fulfilling our obligations under this agreement;<br />
(b) legal and administrative purposes; and<br />

<p><strong>10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p>10.1 It remains at our sole discretion to decide how to allocate the Contributions received in order to develop and execute the Network. The White Paper specifies at a high level how the Contributions are intended to be used but the exact allocation of Contributions shall be at the discretion of the Token Issuing Entity. In addition, the Token Issuing Entity is permitted to take such measures as it deems prudent to manage any Cryptocurrency price fluctuation and network risks including the conversion of ETH received into fiat or other cryptocurrencies or placing some of the ETH received with a third party to manage those assets on our behalf pending realisation of the value for Network development purposes.</p>

<h3>Schedule A</h3>
<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. SOME MATERIAL RISK FACTORS</strong><br />
Contributors are aware of the many risk involved in the purchase, use and sale of tokens and the token sale process. We have outlined below some of the material risks that are obvious to the Company and persons involved in the Token Sale and Network project (including Released Parties):</p>
<p>1.1 <strong>Early Stage Technology</strong>. The Token will be used to develop a Network that is based on, or in some way involved with, distributed ledger technologies (<strong>DLT</strong>). You understand and accept that the use of DLT Tokenised stores of value is highly experimental. Participation in the proposed Token Sale and Network project therefore represents a very high risk to Contributors. The Token Issuing Entity will invest in software and other technologies and that in all cases these technologies and businesses will still be in an early development stage and unproven, and there is an inherent risk that the software, technologies and related businesses invested in by the Token Issuing Entity could be unfit for their intended purpose and/or not have the value expected.</p>
<p>1.2 <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong>. The Token Issuing Entity may wish to store or convert cryptocurrency contributions into one or more fiat and/or alternative cryptocurrencies and there could be significant difficulties in making and managing such cryptocurrencies and funds including relating to the lack of ready convertibility between fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and Tokens and the difficulty in being able to deal with such assets via traditional market counterparties and intermediaries. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuate unfavourably during or after the Token Sale, we may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Network in the manner that is intended. In addition to the usual market forces, there are several potential events which could exacerbate the risk of unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to another DAO-like attack on the Ethereum network; or significant security incidents or market irregularities at one or more of the major cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>1.3<strong> Main Protocol</strong>. Many of the Network project technologies including the Token will, at least initially, be based on the Bitcoin and the Ethereum protocols. Any malfunction, breakdown, forking or abandonment of these protocols may have a material adverse effect on the Network or the Tokens. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present fundamental risks to the value of such protocols and the Network.</p>
<p>1.4 <strong>Risk of software weaknesses</strong>: You understand and accept that the Network and the Tokens, the Contribution software and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early development stage and unproven, and there is no warranty that the process for receiving, use and ownership of Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software, Network, Tokens and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the partial or complete: loss of Tokens; inability to use Tokens; and/or lack of usefulness of Tokens.</p>
<p>1.5 <strong>Risk of blockchain mining attacks</strong>: You understand and accept that, as with other public blockchain based systems that depend upon independent miners, the Network may be susceptible to mining attacks including, but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of Tokens transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.</p>
<p>1.6 <strong>Risk of loss of your credentials</strong>: You understand and accept that if your Wallet credentials are lost or stolen, the obtained Tokens associated with the Contribution will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your Wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your Wallet will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted Wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by, or otherwise related to, the Wallet you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such Wallet, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth herein for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Wallet address, or provide an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.</p>
<p>1.7 <strong>Cybercrime</strong>. The acquisition and management of cryptocurrencies and Tokens is inherently subject to the risk of cybercrime that is difficult to manage and mitigate. This may result in concerted attempts, and even successful attempts, to hack the Network, Token Sale process and the Sites and software and wallets used to manage contributions received in respect of Tokens and other software or technology components and to defraud Contributors and the Token Issuing Entity. The Token Issuing Entity and the Token Sale may be subject to unauthorised access, hacking and/or theft of some of cryptocurrency and Token assets and it may not be possible to successfully insure against the same at a reasonable price or at all. The Token Issuing Entity is not required to insure the assets of the Token Issuing Entity and does not intend to insure the same. Any unauthorised access or cybercrime may result in theft or loss or inability to access Contributions, impacting the ability to issue Tokens, the value of Tokens and may also impact the ability to develop and launch the Network.</p>
<p>1.8 <strong>Failure or Abandonment.</strong> The Token Sale event itself or the Network project may be fully or partially abandoned or required to be re-structured for a number of reasons or remain technologically or commercially unsuccessful, or be shut down for many reasons including e.g., lack of interest from industry and/or the public, changes in law or regulatory issues, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that any Tokens or rights to Token acquired by Contributors will have the value expected or any value at the time of realisation. You therefore understand and accept that the Contribution and/or the allocation, use and ownership of Tokens, carries significant risks that could lead to the Tokens being unusable or valueless particularly as a means to exchange information and services with other Network participants.</p>
<p>1.9 <strong>Regulatory risk</strong>: You understand and accept that DLT and blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, Blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Contribution process and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Network and Token utility including potential loss of Tokens for the Contributor. There is a risk that the offer and/or use of the Tokens could be prohibited under applicable securities law. The Company or any related entity may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction and/or use the Tokens or make it commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
<p>1.10<strong> Risk of uninsured losses</strong>: Tokens do not represent deposits and are not subject to any statutory or private insurance unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of a loss normally there is no public insurance in place or private insurance arranged by the Company, to offer recourse to you.</p>
<p>1.11 <strong>Risk of governance failure</strong>: Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network, Company or Token Issuance Entity, all decisions involving Company’s products or services or that of any subsidiary company within the Network or the Company itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue its products or services on the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the utility of any Tokens you own.</p>
<p>1.12 <strong>Risk of a lack of a suitable legal remedy</strong>: This Token sale is not structured as an offer of securities or a promotion, invitation or solicitation for investment purposes. The terms applicable to unregulated contributions are not normally subject to financial services offering requirements including in respect of documentation or prospectus formats that must meet certain standards required by law. For unregulated Token offerings that do not represent equity, shares, units, royalties or right to capital, profit or income in the network or software or in the entity that issue Tokens and/or any other company or intellectual property associated with the network, or any other public or private enterprise, corporation, foundation or other entity in any jurisdiction. Unregulated Token sales are not therefore intended to represent a security or similar legal interest. The impact on Contributors for investing in unregulated Tokens include that there is no independent review or oversight required by law, accounts of Token offerors may not be subject to audit requirements. In the event of a dispute as to whether (i) Contributions have been appropriately used to meet any legally binding representations made in any Token sale documentation (ii) the Network or Tokens have been developed within the scope of the legally binding representations or function as represented; (iii) the terms and conditions of the Token sale or exchange have been breached (iv) or any other potential legal claim against a Token issuer or any related third parties (<strong>Respondents</strong>), it may prove very difficult and costly for Contributors to assert their legal rights in their home jurisdiction (based on applicable law and jurisdiction and enforcement issues) or in the jurisdiction of the Respondents and this may dissuade Contributors from asserting their legal (including contractual and statutory) rights. In addition, even if a claim is brought it may prove difficult to distinguish between legally binding and enforceable contractual representations, warranties and terms from mere statements of the intended potential future use of a Token that are not sufficiently certain legally binding promises. Terms and conditions of Token sales will also normally take significant care to warn Contributors about the many risks involved in Tokens, Token sales, and the viability of the underlying networks on which Tokens are intended to be used and this may also make it very difficult to bring a claim successfully.</p>
<p>1.13 <strong>Contributors</strong> and all market participants are encouraged to do their own research and consider the following helpful risk warnings and advice on this sector, and particularly the regulatory status of token sales and the risk of loss of value and lack of statutory protection that have been issued by regulators in a number of jurisdictions:</p>
